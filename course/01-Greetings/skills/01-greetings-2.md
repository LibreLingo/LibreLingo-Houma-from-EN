## Grammar

### Sentence Structure
In Uma, the verb always goes at the end of a sentence.

#### "-(y)at"
This ending denotes the subject of a sentence. We use "-at" on nouns that end in a consonant, and "-yat" for nouns that end in a vowel. Subjects go at the beginning of the sentence.

#### Questions as Verbs
In Uma, question words are considered verbs when making sentences, so they go at the end of the sentence. "Nãtah" literally means "is what" or "be what."

So to ask someone what their name is, we start with the noun plus -(y)at, then the question verb:
Tceyulhtcefuyat nãtah?
